Cybersecurity and Online Privacy
===================================

In our rapidly-changing online world, journalists have a lot more to
worry about than their deadlines. Hackings, information leaks, and
subpoenas, have been some of the hottest topics and biggest threats to
news gathering over the past year.

In this course, you'll get an overview of cybersecurity and how it
relates to journalism. You'll also learn a variety of techniques and

computer programs, though.
